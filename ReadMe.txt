Using deep learning, this project aims to develop a method that trains a dataset for sharing such that no confidential data of a patient is leaked.The aim of the project is to develop a system which provides a way to share the weights of the model trained on their datasets so that other clients can use them for their own purposes.
     This provides a method for preserving the privacy and confidentiality of the dataset used for the purpose of training the model at different clients.
